# project1_2bodyproblem

For the first project I wanted to do something simple. I figured that a precursor to the 3-body problem would suffice. This simple simulation uses [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - to visualise the simulation - and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - to calculate the movements of the particles.
